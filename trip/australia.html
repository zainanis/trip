                        <p>The first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator Willem 
                            Janszoon. Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through, and
                             navigated, what is now called Torres Strait and associated islands. Twenty-nine other
                              Dutch navigators explored the western andsouthern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the
                               continent New Holland. Macassan trepangers visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, 
                               possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook
                                charted the east coast of Australia for Great Britain. He returned to London with accounts 
                                favouring colonization at Botany Bay (now in Sydney, New South Wales).</p>

                            The Eureka Rebellion was a rebellion in 1854, instigated by gold miners in Ballarat,
                             Victoria, Australia, who revolted against the colonial authority of the United Kingdom.
                              It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which was fought between miners and
                               the colonial forces of Australia on 3 December 1854 at Eureka Lead and named for the
                                stockade structure built by miners during the conflict. The rebellion resulted in 
                                the deaths of at least 27 people, the majority of whom were rebels

                            When World Expos were the hottest show on the planet during the 19th century, Melbourne
                             was lucky enough to host one – and the Victorian capital built a magnificent exhibition
                              hall to match. Surrounded by the immaculately curated Carlton Gardens, the Royal 
                              Exhibition Building is one of the very few World Expo pavilions that survives in the 
                              21st century, which is why it became the first building in Australia to be given UNESCO 
                              World Heritage status in 2004.

                            Occupied by Aboriginal people for over 40,000 years, Kakadu National Park has over five
                             thousand ancient rock art sites which are fascinating to visit. It is a place of immense
                              cultural and natural significance. The park is huge and contains some stunning natural 
                              sights which make it well worth a visit; the Kakadu Escarpment is particularly 
                              breathtaking. With diverse ecosystems contained within the park’s boundaries, you can be
                               hiking through deserted sandstone escarpments one minute and bathing in waterfalls and
                                pools the next, before later on learning about some of the ancient rock paintings.
                                 While it can get very popular, Kakadu’s huge area means that you can easily enjoy all
                                  the park has to offer in peace and quiet if you step off the beaten path a little.

                            The largest coral reef system on the face of the earth, the Great Barrier Reef is
                             simply colossal. Stretching for over 2,300 kilometers, it is remarkably visible from 
                             space, and nine hundred islands dot this enormous ecosystem, which is actually comprised
                              of 2,900 individual reefs. Visiting the Great Barrier Reef is a humbling experience; 
                              every year around two million visitors enjoy all that this natural wonder has to offer.
                               Snorkeling and scuba diving are the best ways to experience the joys of the rich 
                               underwater world, while boat trips, kayaking, and even helicopter rides offer another 
                               view of the reef’s gargantuan proportions. Gently sailing through the perfect turquoise
                                waters, dolphins, sea turtles and the reef itself are visible below the waves – an

                            Almost picture perfect, Sydney is a fantastic city with a lot going for it. A modern city
                             with a long history, Sydney is defined by its scenic harbor. The region’s first 
                             inhabitants lived along the harbor’s bank for thousands of years. The harbor was also the 
                             landing site for convicts sent to Australia during the 1780s. Today, ferries take visitors 
                             for cruises under the famed Sydney Harbor Bridge and past the iconic Sydney Opera House. 
                             While those famous landmarks are the undoubted highlights, the city has much more to offer.
                              With lots of museums, theaters and cinemas dotted about town, Sydney’s thriving cultural 
                              scene means that there is always something to see and do. As such, the city is great to live
                               in and the fantastic beaches on offer only add to its attractiveness. The beautiful Bondi
                                Beach is a must-see when visiting Sydney. Outdoor activities play a large role in 
                                Australian culture. Surrounding the city, there are a number of brilliant national parks
                                 for visitors and locals alike to enjoy, as well as some interesting and educational
